## Authenticated requests

Enable user authentication via environment variable, each front-end API request includes an API key and OAuth2 token. These authenticate the request. Without proper permissions, the backend responds with a `4XX` error.


## API Errors

If a page loads with no visible data, it could indicate either a lack of data or insufficient user permissions.

If no error message appears on the page, check the browserâ€™s network tab and inspect the API request response for full error details.

<Tip>Learn how to view the network requests in Chrome by following these [instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/)</Tip>
