## API Key Management

* **Regenerate Key** : If you need to regenerate your key, follow the same steps as above. The old key will be deactivate.

## Authenticated requests

Enable user authentication via environment variable, each front-end API request includes an API key and OAuth2 token. These authenticate the request. Without proper permissions, the backend responds with a `4XX` error.


## API Errors

If a page loads with no visible data, it could indicate either a lack of data or insufficient user permissions.

If no error message appears on the page, check the browserâ€™s network tab and inspect the API request response for full error details.

| Error Code | Description |
| :--------: | :---------: |
|   `401`    | 	Expired / Invalid OAuth token |
|   `402`    | 	Record is Invalid |
|   `403`    | 	Invalid API Key |
|   `403`    | 	Unauthorized access |
|   `404`    | 	Record not found |
|   `500  `    | 	API resource error |
